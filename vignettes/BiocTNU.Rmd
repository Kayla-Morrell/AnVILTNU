# Introduction

The [DataBiosphere project](https://www.databiosphere.org) includes a vision

![schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vjcitn/BiocTNU/main/databiosfig.jpg)

of which AnVIL/Terra forms a part.

The [terra-notebook-utils python modules](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/terra-notebook-utils)
is described as a "Python API and CLI providing utilities for working with DRS objects, VCF files, and the Terra notebook environment."

This R package aims to provide a regulated interface between R and terra-notebook-utils
for use in AnVIL.  

By "regulated" we mean that the entire python ecosystem used
to work with terra-notebook-utils is defined in a virtual environment.
We make some exceptions for the sake of demonstration, but, for example,
the `drs_access` command uses a very particular interface between
R and python, using the Bioconductor [basilisk](https://bioconductor.org/packages/basilisk) package.

# Basic concepts

## Installing in an AnVIL workspace, Oct 2022

As of 10/2022, BiocTNU exists in a github repository.  To install and use
properly with R in AnVIL

- ensure there is a .Renviron file in the home folder with content `PIP_USER=false`
- use `BiocManager::install("vjcitn/BiocTNU")`
- verify that `library(BiocTNU); example(drs_access)` produces a signed URL

## Probing available features

Once installation has succeeded, we use basilisk-mediated commands defined
in the BiocTNU package to probe or use terra-notebook-utils.  We
can get the names of all modules available after importing terra-notebook-utils.
```{r lk1}
library(BiocTNU)
tnu_top()
```

We can also retrieve the help content for the python modules subordinate
to terra-notebook-utils.

```{r lk2}
cat(tnu_help())
```

## Generating signed URLS

The default argument to `drs_access` is the google storage location of a CRAI file.
```{r lk3}
substr(drs_access(), 1, 80)
```

More features related to DRS become available when basilisk interfaces are added
to this package.

```{r lk4}
cat(tnu_drs_help())
```
